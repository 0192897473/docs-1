title: Environments
---

Railway environments give you an isolated instance of all plugins in a project.
You can use them to

- Have development environments for each team member that are identical to the
  production environment
- Have separate staging and production environments

Each environment has the same plugins. When a new plugin is added to the
project, an instance of that plugin is created for each environment.
