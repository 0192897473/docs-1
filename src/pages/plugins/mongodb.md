The Railway MongoDB plugin allows you to provision and connect to a
MongoDB database with zero configuration.

## Install

When you run `railway run` in a project with the MongoDB plugin installed, we inject several environment variables.

- MONGOHOST
- MONGOPORT
- MONGOUSER
- MONGOPASSWORD
- MONGO_URL
