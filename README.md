## Using Vale Locally

We've added a small GitHub Action that lints our documentation. It uses an app called [Vale](https://vale.sh). Vale is great, and you can use it locally to analyse your contributions for spelling mistakes and much more. Here is how to use it:

1) clone this repo
2) make sure [Vale is installed](https://vale.sh) locally
3) from this project's root directory, run `vale ./src/docs/`

If you want to test with more rules, modify the configuration file `vale.ini` and the `styles` directory inside the `.github` directory. Reference the [Vale docs](https://vale.sh) for more info.
